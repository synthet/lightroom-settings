# Antigravity Rules

This project uses several MCP tools to streamline development. Available MCPs:
- `lightroom`: Connects directly to Adobe Lightroom Classic for metadata reads/writes and photo management.
- `serena`: Semantic codebase search and refactoring operations.
- `memory`: Knowledge graph storage for architecture decisions.
- `fetch`: To fetch web pages.
- `filesystem` & `git`: For general OS and version control access.

## General Guidelines
1. **Always** check the active `memory` graph or create new entities when establishing a new architecture pattern.
2. For Lightroom interactions, prioritize using the `lightroom` MCP rather than trying to reverse-engineer catalog SQL databases.
3. Refer to `.agents/workflows/` for specific usage guides for these MCPs.
